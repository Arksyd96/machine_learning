# **Machine learning**

### Introduction:
- Machine learning helps to reproduce tasks that cannot be programmed by hand and taks that are made by humans. It is also used for data mining and self-customizing programs (Customizing preferences and data).
- ML gives the capability to machines to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Types of ML :
  - Supervised learning: We're given a dataset with labels, in other words, we already know what our output should look like. Supervised learning is categorized into :
    1. Regression problems: Predicting output within a continuous domain of definition (Mapping to a continuous function).
    2. Classification problems: Predicting output in a descrete domain of definition (Mapping to a descrete categories, can be seen as a step function).
  - Unsupervised learning: We're given a dataset without knowing how our results should look like and don't necessarily know the effect of each variable. A solution is usually to cluster data based on relationships among the variables. With unsupervised learning, there's no feedback on the prediction results.
  - Other: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.
